A highly customizable IntelliJ plugin that adds stylish Rich Presence support to enhance your Discord status.

## ✨ Features

- Display your work in Discord!
- Customize with variables
- Change display mode per project (or hide the project)
- Support for more than 20 languages (with more to come)
- Support for all JetBrains IDEs
- Use custom Discord application id

## 💭 The motivation

But wait, aren't there a lot of Discord integration plugins already? So why create another one?

Well, here's the thing: the existing plugins that offer Rich Presence support have either been left unmaintained
or don't provide a good enough experience that I was happy with. That's why I decided to make this plugin,
which gives the user the freedom to customize almost everything while ensuring a premium and polished feel.

## 📥 Installation

The recommended way to install this plugin is through the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24027-discord-rich-presence),
but there are alternative ways. You can also download a distribution of the plugin in the
[release page](https://github.com/pandier/intellij-discord-rp/releases) or a build
available under every commit through GitHub actions (these builds aren't signed).

## ⚙️ Settings

The settings menu can be opened in **File -> Settings -> Discord Rich Presence**, where you can customize your Rich Presence.
Settings are split into three display modes: **Application**, **Project** and **File**. The File display mode is shown
when the user is editing a file. Otherwise, the Project mode is displayed. The Application display mode is only shown
if configured either as default display mode, or changed in a project using **Tools -> Discord Rich Presence -> Project Display Mode**
or the **Settings -> Discord Rich Presence -> Project** settings menu.

Each display mode can be configured using the corresponding tab. Variables are used for showing information in text fields, here's a list of them:

| Variable                             | File mode | Project mode | Application mode | Value                                                             |
